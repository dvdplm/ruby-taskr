=== 0.3.0 :: In progress...

* Added "Run Now" function allowing a task to be immediately triggered.
* The Rest action can now take the 'params' parameter as a CGI string
  (e.g. foo=bar&blah=hello&taskr=awesome). The string does not have
  to be properly URI-encoded, since the algorithm for parsing it simply
  splits it based on & and = symbols. 

=== 0.2.1 :: 2008-02-28

* Updated for compatibility with picnic 0.6.1.

=== 0.2.0 :: 2008-01-03

* Added Taskr4rails action and accompanying Rails plugin for
  executing code on a remote Rails server. See
  http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/wiki/Taskr4rails for
  details.
* The Howlr action now takes an optional content_type parameter
  to allow for sending out HTML-formatted messages.
* Better error reporting for Restr-based actions. The remote server's
  response body is now included in Taskr's error report and the 
  remote output is printed to the log more cleanly.
* Change to REST API: the 'action(s)' parameter is now a bit looser. 
  You can use 'action' or 'actions' interchangeably, whether you're 
  scheduling multiple actions or just one.
* Fixed some routing problems in the HTML views.
* The ActiveResource and PHP examples have been updated with
  some more illustrative code and better explanations.
* Misc bugs fixed while writing extensive documentation. See
  wiki pages at http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/w/list.

=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-12-21

* First public release.
