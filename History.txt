=== In Progress...

* Log entries in task view can now be filtered by date. By default only entries
  from the last 24 hours are shown.
* Added experimental 'dont_wait' parameter to the Taskr4Rails action that 
  forces the remote code to be forked so that it does not hold up the entire 
  server. Currently this will only work if the remote Rails server is running 
  on Mongrel. 

=== 0.3.0 :: 2008-06-19

* Added "Run Now" function allowing a task to be immediately triggered.
* The Rest action can now take the 'params' parameter as a CGI string
  (e.g. foo=bar&blah=hello&taskr=awesome). The string does not have
  to be properly URI-encoded, since the algorithm for parsing it simply
  splits it based on & and = symbols.
* Changed Scheduler gem from the old OpenWFE to the new Rufus.
* Task executions are now logged to the new log_entries table. These
  log entries are viewable under the task detail page.
* Exceptions raised when a task is run manually are now handled gracefully
  (or rather, silently, since they should be logged by the action).
* Blank parameter values are now correctly stored as NULL rather than 0.

=== 0.2.1 :: 2008-02-28

* Updated for compatibility with picnic 0.6.1.

=== 0.2.0 :: 2008-01-03

* Added Taskr4rails action and accompanying Rails plugin for
  executing code on a remote Rails server. See
  http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/wiki/Taskr4rails for
  details.
* The Howlr action now takes an optional content_type parameter
  to allow for sending out HTML-formatted messages.
* Better error reporting for Restr-based actions. The remote server's
  response body is now included in Taskr's error report and the 
  remote output is printed to the log more cleanly.
* Change to REST API: the 'action(s)' parameter is now a bit looser. 
  You can use 'action' or 'actions' interchangeably, whether you're 
  scheduling multiple actions or just one.
* Fixed some routing problems in the HTML views.
* The ActiveResource and PHP examples have been updated with
  some more illustrative code and better explanations.
* Misc bugs fixed while writing extensive documentation. See
  wiki pages at http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/w/list.

=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-12-21

* First public release.
