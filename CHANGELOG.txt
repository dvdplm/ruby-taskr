=== 0.2.0 :: 2008-01-02

* Added Taskr4rails action and accompanying Rails plugin for
  tasks that execute code on a remote Rails server. See
  http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/wiki/Taskr4rails for
  details.
* The Howlr action now takes an optional content_type parameter
  to allow for sending out HTML-formatted messages.
* Change to REST API: the 'action(s)' parameter is now a bit looser. 
  You can use 'action' or 'actions' interchangeably, whether you're 
  scheduling multiple actions or just one.
* Fixed some routing problems in the HTML views.
* The ActiveResource and PHP examples have been updated with
  some more illustrative code and better explanations.
* Misc bugs fixed while writing extensive documentation. See
  wiki pages at http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/w/list.

=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-12-21
