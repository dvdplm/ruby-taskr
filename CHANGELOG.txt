=== In Progress...

* The Howlr action now takes an optional content_type parameter
  to allow for sending out HTML-formatted messages.
* REST API: 'action(s)' parameter is now a bit looser. You can use
  'action' or 'actions' interchangably, whether you're scheduling
  multiple actions or not.
* Fixed some routing problems in the HTML views.
* The ActiveResource and PHP examples have been updated with
  some more illustrative code and better explanations.

=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-12-21

* First public release.
